# @phosphor-icons/swift

This repository hosts the raw SVGs and catalog data – including tags, categories, and release versions – of all icons in the [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com) family. It serves as the basis for our fuzzy-search on our website and other tools, and as a dev dependency in the build process in some of our framework-specific libraries. You may find this package is useful to you in implementing a port of Phosphor to your preferred framework, or as a source of truth for our current SVG assets.
